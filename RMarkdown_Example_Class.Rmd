Note that I added a table of contents compared to the class version. toc_float puts it to the side, play around with removing it. 

If you have some packages you want to load, you can do them here (instead of doing it further down right before we plot something.)

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

You can hide it like this (won't show). 

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```

# **1. Make a new header **


# **1. Dataset Information**

The __shelter.csv__ dataset contains variables collected from adult cats and dogs that were adopted at the Austin Animal shelter over the course of one month.

First, you'll want to import in the dataset (note that the default working directory is the folder in which this .Rmd file is located):

```{r}
shelter <- read.csv('shelter.csv')
```

Let's get a summary of the variables:

```{r}
summary(shelter)
```

## **Cases** ##
Let's look at a few rows of the dataset: 
```{r}
head(shelter)
```

# **2. Making Tables**

You can create a table manually like the example below, which describes the variables in this dataset:

 Variable | Description
--------|------------------------------------------------------
ID | Unique identifier
Intake.Type | How animal arrived at the shelter
Species | Dog or cat
Sex | Female or male
Age.Intake | Age (years) at intake
Condition | Animal's health condition 
Intake.Weight | Weight (lbs) at intake
Adopted.Weight | Weight (lbs) at adoption
Days.to.Adoption | Days spent in the shelter



# **3. Code and Output**

Code is run linearly (dependent on what is run above):

```{r}
mean(shelter$Days.to.Adoption)
```

You can suppress the code:

```{r echo=FALSE}
mean(shelter$Days.to.Adoption)
```

You can also suppress the output:

```{r results='hide'}
mean(shelter$Days.to.Adoption)
```


# **4. Graphs and Embedding Code**

[Note that here I added the standard deviation and rounded to 2 decimal places.]

[Also note that this is called "inline" R code - you will be asked to do it in your homework.]

On average, animals spent `r mean(shelter$Days.to.Adoption)` days with a standard deviation of `r round(sd(shelter$Days.to.Adoption),2)` before being adopted.

Code not hidden:

```{r}
# Make a histogram of days to adopt variable
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(shelter, aes(x=Days.to.Adoption)) +  geom_histogram(binwidth=10, col='black', fill='maroon') + xlab('Number of Days to Adoption') + ggtitle('Distribution of Days to Adoption') + theme_classic()
```

Code hidden and only plotting histogram:

```{r echo = FALSE}
# Make a histogram of days to adopt variable
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(shelter, aes(x=Days.to.Adoption)) +  geom_histogram(binwidth=10, col='black', fill='maroon') + xlab('Number of Days to Adoption') + ggtitle('Distribution of Days to Adoption') + theme_classic()
```

Make some text stand out like this:

> _This has been a great day!_

You can write some math equations like this: 

Let $\alpha\ = 5$ and $\beta\ = 14$.

# **5 Class Exercises, Part 2 **

Pick another variable from this dataset and investigate if the number of days to adoption is related to it or not. I will pick the variable Condition which is equal to Normal, Injured, or Sick. The code below pulls from code used in class on August 29 and August 31.  
```{r}
aggregate(Days.to.Adoption~Condition, data=shelter, mean)
```
Dogs and cats that are not sick or injured seem to be adopted more quickly. The average days to adoption for Normal animals is `r mean(shelter$Days.to.Adoption[shelter$Condition == "Normal"])`, the average days to adoption for Injured animals is `r mean(shelter$Days.to.Adoption[shelter$Condition == "Injured"])`, and the average days to adoption for Sick animals is `r mean(shelter$Days.to.Adoption[shelter$Condition == "Sick"])`.

Here is another way to do it: 

```{r}
mytable = aggregate(Days.to.Adoption~Condition, data=shelter, mean)

my.table = table(shelter$Condition)
my.table
library(kableExtra)
kable_styling(kbl(my.table, col.names = c("Animal Condition", "My Count")), full_width=FALSE)

```
The average days to adoption for Normal animals is `r mytable[2,2]`, the average days to adoption for Injured animals is `r mytable[1,2]`, and the average days to adoption for Sick animals is `r mytable[3,2]`.

Now let's make a plot. This is one numeric and one categorical variable. 

```{r}
 ggplot(shelter) + geom_histogram(aes(x=Days.to.Adoption),fill='pink', bins = 20)  + labs(title='Days to Adoption by Condition',x='Days to Adoption',y='Frequency') + theme(legend.position='bottom') + facet_wrap(~Condition)
```

Present your statistics in a bulleted list. Note that spacing and tabs in the text below is VERY important. If you don't have a space between * and The, it won't work. If the spacing is off for the +, it won't work.


* The average days to adoption by condition is:
  +  `r round(mean(shelter$Days.to.Adoption[shelter$Condition == "Normal"]),2)` for Normal animals
  +  `r round(mean(shelter$Days.to.Adoption[shelter$Condition == "Injured"]),2)` for Injured animals
  +  `r round(mean(shelter$Days.to.Adoption[shelter$Condition == "Sick"]),2)` for Sick animals

Include a picture of a cute cat or dog. You must have the file of the photo you are using *in your working directory*.


```{r}
my.tab = table(shelter$Condition)
my.tab
library(kableExtra)
my.new.tab = kbl(my.tab)
my.new.tab = kbl(my.tab, col.names = c("Condition", "Count"))
kable_styling(my.new.tab)
```
